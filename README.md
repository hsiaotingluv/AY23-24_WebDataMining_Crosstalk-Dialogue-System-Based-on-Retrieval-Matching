The objective of this project was to develop a retrieval-based dialogue system tailored for
Chinese crosstalk (相声), a traditional Chinese comedic performance art. The system's
purpose is to accurately select contextually appropriate responses in a crosstalk scenario,
thereby mimicking the interactive and humorous essence of this art form.

The dataset employed is a comprehensive collection of Chinese crosstalk dialogues,
segmented into training, validation, and test sets. This dataset plays a crucial role in
understanding the nuances of crosstalk, which is characterized by its unique cultural context,
linguistic style, and humor. The system aims to grasp these subtleties to generate relevant
and engaging responses, reflecting the dynamic nature of crosstalk.
